### Experiments

Experiments that need to be run 

1. Comparison between the models with and without GDP Data.
2. Comparison of the Models with and without PCA 
3. Comparison of the models with and withtout Smote oversampling
4. Comparison of a Regression vs Classification 
5. Once above identified, comparision of the models with different train test  splits
6. Once consistent preprocessing steps identified across all models. Hyperparameter tuning initially using 
random search and if time allows implement hill climbing, simulated annealing or genetic algorithm.
7. If time allows comparison of models with and without outliers included.
8. Consider comparing results when full dataset is used opposed to subset where scf offered == true.
