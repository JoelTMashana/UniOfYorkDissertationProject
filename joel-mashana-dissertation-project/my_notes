Basic structure of combined DF - pre cleaning
Shape (5636, 224) - high dimensionality
Data types Period = Object, rest = float64


'Average time to pay',
    '% Invoices paid within 30 days',
    '% Invoices paid between 31 and 60 days',
    '% Invoices paid later than 60 days',
The cols all have missing data across the same rows 
may need to check if this concides with missing data in this col ''% Invoices not paid within agreed terms''
before my encoding operation
- Answer: it doesnt
- need to consider removing those rows. alternativetly, could use mean imputation but would need to consider the best way to do that
for example it might be best to only use means for that those specific companies insetead of means of the entire col. 
big question is, is that worth it for just 8 rows of data. Could be a couple hours worth of work.


The bools are from the 'Payments made in the reporting period'
2018 JUL - 2018 DEC	12570	AMEY HOLDINGS LIMITED	05438319	FALSE
2018 JUL - 2018 DEC	12404	MANN + HUMMEL (UK) LIMITED	03152081	TRUE
2018 JUL - 2018 DEC	12567	AMEY UK PLC	04736639	FALSE
Suggesting that the col should not simply be encoded in oppoisites where data are missing
therefore it is not certain that where there is no data the opposite bool can be assumed

Longest standard payment period - has 1600 missing values.
